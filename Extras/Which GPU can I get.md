# The best GPUs for Deep Learning
I found a great article that explain everything! Written by Tim Dettmers, a PhD Student from USA.
Talks about everything, from if it is worth for you to get a GPU for DL training/inference to how a GPU works at a low level vs a CPU.

The TLDR is that you probablity should not get one, because us undergrads are not going to get that much use out of it. But it can also me used for gaming so it is not useless. Get a Nvidia one.
