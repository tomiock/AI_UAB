Here there is an example of a project that we did on the course 2023-2024. The chapter of the book is Continuous Opmization. In summary, we had to make a presentation and ~15 page document exaplining a chapter of the book *Math for Machine Learning*. 

On the folder there is also the LaTeX code that we used to make the document, in case you are curious. Our mark was a 10, so you can use it as a reference.
