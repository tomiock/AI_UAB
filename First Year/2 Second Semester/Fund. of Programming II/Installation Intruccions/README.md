I personally recommend to install the C compiler using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), for this subject and Fund. of Computing. 
On the second part of Fund. of Computing you will have to use Linux in some way or another. Its much better to get familiar with it from the beginning, so use this subject to start.

This is to get familiar with Linux. In the future, to make AIs, you are going to connect to a server that has Linux, no Windows (we are just big fans of doors) - *Tomi*

Consult this [gist](https://gist.github.com/tomiock/143336302d09c0fa328b6874b673a19b) if you have any issues getting the VSC setup. Also check the official tutorial ([Using C++ and WSL in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-wsl)). 

If you are already using MacOS or Linux, then do not worry about it.
