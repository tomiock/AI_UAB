I personally recommend to install the C compiler using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
This is to get familiar with Linux. In the future, to make AIs, you are going to connect to a server has Linux, no Windows. We just use doors. - *Tomi*

Consult this [gist](https://gist.github.com/tomiock/143336302d09c0fa328b6874b673a19b) if you have any issues getting the VSC setup. Also check the official tutorial ([Using C++ and WSL in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-wsl)). 

If you are already using MacOS or Linux, then do not worry about it.
