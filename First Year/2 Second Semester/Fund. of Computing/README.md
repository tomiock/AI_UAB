Use WSL to install Linux on your Windows laptop, it will be necessary to do some exercises. [Here there is an official tutorial by Microsoft to install it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), and another one [that shows you the basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/linux).

Maybe the teacher will tell you to do a virtual machine -a full Ubuntu desktop on your laptop inside of Windows-, I do not recommend that, WSL its much more easier. 

Also I recommend to use Ubuntu/Linux and not Windows, consider this specially if your laptop is only used for the university - Tomi
